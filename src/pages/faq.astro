const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What exactly do I get?',
    answer: 'You get a complete, custom-built directory website. This includes: custom design (no templates), static site generation using Astro or Next.js, search and filter functionality, responsive design for all devices, SEO optimization (meta tags, sitemaps, schema markup), Google Analytics setup, and deployment. You also get documentation on how to update content.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take?',
    answer: 'Standard projects are delivered in 14 days from kickoff to launch. This assumes you provide the necessary information and data in a timely manner. If you need the data research add-on, it may add a few days depending on the scope.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to provide the data?',
    answer: 'You can launch with your own data. Every plan includes CSV template + field mapping and data import (up to a row limit by plan). Data enrichment is optional and only needed if you want me to source, clean, and verify listings for you.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What tech stack do you use?',
    answer: 'I primarily use Astro for static sites and Next.js for more complex applications. Both are modern, fast, and SEO-friendly frameworks. Styling is done with Tailwind CSS. The sites are deployed to Vercel or Netlify for optimal performance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will my directory rank on Google?',
    answer: 'I build every directory with SEO best practices: fast load times, proper URL structure, schema markup, sitemaps, and mobile optimization. However, SEO is a long-term game. I can\'t guarantee rankings, but I give your site the best possible foundation to succeed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I update the content myself?',
    answer: 'Yes. For static sites, content is typically managed through markdown files or a headless CMS like Sanity or Strapi. I\'ll provide documentation and training on how to make updates. For larger projects, I can set up a proper admin dashboard.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer hosting?',
    answer: 'Hosting is not included in the project price. I recommend Vercel or Netlify for static sites (both have generous free tiers) or a VPS for more complex needs. I can help you set up hosting as part of the launch process.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about ongoing maintenance?',
    answer: 'I offer a monthly maintenance package ($99/month) that includes content updates, security patches, technical support, and minor tweaks. This is optional—you\'re free to maintain the site yourself or hire someone else.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does payment work?',
    answer: '50% upfront to book your spot, 50% on completion. I accept PayPal invoices or crypto (USDC/USDT). For projects over $1,000, I can do a 3-payment structure: 30% upfront, 40% at midpoint, 30% on completion.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I need changes after launch?',
    answer: 'Minor tweaks within 30 days of launch are included. Major changes or new features are billed separately. If you have the monthly maintenance package, small content updates are included.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work with any niche?',
    answer: 'Almost any. I\'ve built directories for climbing gyms and golf simulators. I\'m open to other niches—local businesses, SaaS tools, creators, events, products, etc. If I don\'t think your niche is a good fit for a directory, I\'ll tell you honestly.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you add user reviews or user submissions?',
    answer: 'Yes, but this requires a database and moves the project from a static site to a dynamic application. This is typically an Enterprise-level feature and increases complexity and cost. Let\'s discuss your specific requirements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer refunds?',
    answer: 'If I haven\'t started work yet, yes—full refund. Once work begins, the deposit is non-refundable but can be transferred to a future project. I\'m transparent about progress, so you\'ll always know where we stand.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why should I choose you over a cheaper alternative?',
    answer: 'Fair question. I\'m not the cheapest option because I don\'t cut corners. I write clean, maintainable code. I optimize for performance and SEO from day one. I actually care about your project succeeding because my reputation depends on it. You\'re not just buying a website—you\'re buying expertise and a partner who wants your directory to rank.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get started?',
    answer: 'Send me an email at tim@stackbasesystem.com with details about your niche and what you\'re looking to build. I\'ll review it and get back to you within 24 hours with an async project brief and next steps.'
